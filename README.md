# Australian Fire Interactive Dashboard
During my bootcamp, I was tasked to do a simple interactive dashboard using shiny and shinydashboard for homework. I searched through tidytuesday and found data about the Australian Fire, which I think is very fitting for this project. 

## Dependencies
- tidyverse
- plotly
- glue
- shinydashboard
- shiny
- leaflet
- ggrepel
- DT
- lubridate

I was able to use the lessons I learnt here and apply it to the interactive dashboard I made for my Capstone project. I felt very passionate about this project because doing it helped hone my creativity that has long been suppressed within me!
